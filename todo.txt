- Some preprocessing (resizing to 28*28 for example) is not needed any more. Remove it.
- The preprocessing should be included in the segment_recognition_file
- Unit tests are needed. Also integration tests.
- The digit_segments is a pretty nice module. Though, I would make the public interface array only. 
- I think I can use one single settings dataclass. Each module just defines a protocol on what they need.
- The calibrate module is ugly, though who cares.
- The verify quality module is quite ugly too, again I don't care much about it.
- I need to properly install dependencies. 
- I need to run mypy, the types are a lie now!
- I need some cicd maybe. or maybe not
